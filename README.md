Overview
========
This project contains the following tools:
* `satpass` calculates satellite passes at a given location, given a TLE file
* `sattrack` calculates the location of satellite at a given point in time,
  or period, and optionally its visibility from a location on earth
* `termgen` generates the coordinates of well-known places on earth, in a format
  that can be used be `satpass` and `sattrack`
* `tleinfo` reads one or more TLE-files and presents their contents in human-readable
  format
* `tlegen` generates TLE-files describing the orbits of simulated satellites.

Each tools contains built-in help that can be accessed by invoking it with the
`--help` option. Additional details can be found below.
